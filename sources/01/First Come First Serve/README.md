# First Come First Serve(FCFS) Scheduling

First Come First Served (FCFS) is a Non-Preemptive scheduling algorithm. FIFO (First In First Out) strategy assigns priority to process in the order in which they request the processor. The process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first. This is easily implemented with a FIFO queue for managing the tasks. As the process come in, they are put at the end of the queue. As the CPU finishes each task, it removes it from the start of the queue and heads on to the next task.
